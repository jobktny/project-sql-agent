Bakehouse in Tenmonkan, Kagoshima, has truly captured my heart with their exquisite cookie selection. Among their offerings, the Outback Oatmeal and Austin Almond Biscotti stand out as absolute favorites. The Outback Oatmeal cookie, with its perfect balance of oats and sweetness, provides a satisfying crunch in every bite. Meanwhile, the Austin Almond Biscotti, with its delicate almond flavor and perfect texture, pairs beautifully with a warm cup of coffee.

The Orchard Oasis and Golden Gate Ginger cookies also deserve praise. Orchard Oasis is a delightful burst of fruity flavors, while Golden Gate Ginger offers a pleasant kick of spice that warms the palate. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Tokyo Tidbits, which are perfect for those who enjoy a lighter, crispier cookie.

Although I didn't try the Pearly Pies, I've heard great things about them from fellow cookie enthusiasts. Bakehouse has certainly made a name for itself in Tenmonkan, and I wholeheartedly recommend a visit for anyone with a sweet tooth. The combination of quality ingredients, unique flavors, and a welcoming atmosphere makes Bakehouse a must-visit destination in Kagoshima."

Disappointing experience at Bakehouse in Seattle. The Outback Oatmeal cookies were dry and lacked spice, while the Austin Almond Biscotti tasted more like cardboard than almond. The Orchard Oasis cookies, with their promising fruit flavors, were overly sweet and crumbly. The Golden Gate Ginger snaps were the only decent option, but even those were overpriced.

Bakehouse in Bondi Beach, Sydney, offers an exceptional cookie experience. Their Outback Oatmeal cookies are a perfect blend of chewy and crunchy, with a generous helping of oats and a hint of cinnamon. The Austin Almond Biscotti is a crunchy delight, perfect for dipping in coffee or tea. Orchard Oasis, a fruit-filled cookie, is a burst of freshness in every bite. The Golden Gate Ginger cookies are a spicy-sweet treat that leaves you wanting more. Tokyo Tidbits, small and delicate, are packed with flavor and a delightful surprise. Pearly Pies, while not a cookie, are a must-try - mini pie treats that melt in your mouth. Bakehouse is a must-visit for cookie lovers in Sydney!

Bakehouse in Fitzroy, Melbourne, has truly outdone themselves with their outstanding cookie selection. The Outback Oatmeal and Austin Almond Biscotti are undeniable favorites. The Outback Oatmeal cookie, with its perfect balance of oats and sweetness, provides a satisfying crunch that leaves you craving more. Simultaneously, the Austin Almond Biscotti, with its delicate almond flavor and crisp texture, pairs exceptionally well with a warm cup of coffee.

The Orchard Oasis and Golden Gate Ginger cookies are equally impressive. Orchard Oasis offers a delightful burst of fruity flavors, while Golden Gate Ginger packs a punch with its spicy and sweet combination. Both cookies showcase Bakehouse's commitment to using high-quality ingredients and their ability to create unique and delicious flavor profiles.

Tokyo Tidbits and Pearly Pies, while not my personal favorites, still demonstrate the bakery's creativity and attention to detail. Tokyo Tidbits, with their petite size and subtle flavors, are perfect for those who prefer a lighter treat. Pearly Pies, on the other hand, are a delightful surprise, combining the comfort of a pie with the portability of a cookie.

In summary, Bakehouse in Fitzroy, Melbourne, is a must-visit for any cookie enthusiast. Their diverse selection, high-quality ingredients, and creative flavor combinations make for an unforgettable cookie experience."
